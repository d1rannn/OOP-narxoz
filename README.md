### Repository for OOP-Narxoz Lessons. 
something went wrong with previous repo, so i had to create new repo and learn more about git. (¬_¬")

Update(20 Feb. 12:19 AM): If you are watching this message, then you and i have accessibility to BitLab problems, which means i have some mistakes in problems, because ive done all problems not in bitlab, which also meant that sovling may be false (yes, it is). So i mean in future i will change solvings of problems. 

Update(25 Feb. 12:20 AM): Sorry for not being here for 5 days. (funny thing is im updating this repo after exactly 5 days) but anyways, i was hardly doing full bitlab for this 5 days, not me i mean me, friends and gpt(not for every problem, like yk). OK, nevermind, so ive done all bitlab problems for spring 2024.

Here is all almost my solvings.
