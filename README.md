### Repository for OOP-Narxoz Lessons. 
something went wrong with previous repo, so i had to create new repo and learn more about git. (¬_¬")

Update(20 Feb. 12:19 AM): If you are watching this message, then you and i have accessibility to BitLab problems, which means i have some mistakes in problems, because ive done all problems not in bitlab, which also meant that sovling may be false (yes, it is). So i mean in future i will change solvings of problems.
